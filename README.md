# Tinder-Reviews-Sentiment-Analysis-using-Python

Tinder is a popular dating application that connects people based on their interests. Users can create a profile with their photos, brief description, and swipe through other user profiles to find potential matches. If two users swipe right on each other's profiles, they can start chatting and potentially meet up in person. [[1]](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinder)

Tinder has become an important app in the dating world and has disrupted the traditional way of dating. With the app's simple swipe-based system, it has become a popular choice for many people to find potential partners. 

Sentimental analysis of Tinder reviews can help to gain insights into how users perceive the app and what aspects of the app they find positive, negative or neutral. By analyzing the sentiment of the reviews, we can also understand how well the app is meeting the needs of its users.

In this project, we use Python and several libraries, including `pandas`, `matplotlib`, `nltk`, `re`, and `wordcloud`, to analyze the sentiments of Tinder users based on their reviews on the Google Play Store. We first collect the data using the Google Play API and then clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis.

We also generate word clouds to visualize the most common words in the reviews and gain insights into what users are saying about Tinder.

The dataset is downloaded from [[Kaggle]](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivkumarganesh/tinder-google-play-store-review?resource=download)
